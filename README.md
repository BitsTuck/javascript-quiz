## Description

The JavaScript Quiz, challenge #4, aimed to test our JavaScript skills and logic. We were supposed to set a timer to answer 5 questions, only revealing the next question when the correct answer is given to the present question. For every wrong answer, we were to remove 10 seconds from the clock. At the end, players were supposed to be able to put in their initials and view high scores.

## Installation

N/A

## Challenges

This really did test the limits of my JavaScript capabilities. I did not complete all of the acceptance criteria (there are no scores, no initials, and when you click the wrong answer the quiz advances anyway). 

I definitely got too muddled working through this, and could not "see" the smaller steps needed in order to achieve the larger picture, and therefore success. I am confident that with some space and a little bit more experience, I can return to this project and make it firstly complete, and secondly more polished/appealing.

## Credits

Additional guidance was given by instructor Leah Nelson and TA Diem Ly in office hours. Tutor Dru Sanchez also provided guidance.
